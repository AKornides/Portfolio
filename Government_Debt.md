Understanding the debt to GDP is an important indicator of a nation's financial health. While the previous graph looks at the ratio of debt to GDP through time by using a line graph, the data visualization above looks to see if there are any trends by utilizing the trend line. Trend lines are used to understand how the dots on a scatter plot align, if there is a high correlation between the x and y axis.
