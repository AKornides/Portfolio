I found this visualization in a strange, roundabout way. Recently a televsion program I enjoy was nominated for a GLAAD Best New Series award and upon hearing about its nomination, I was interested in check out GLAAD's website to see if there was information about LGBTQ+ representation on television and in film. I knew, as a child growing up in the 2000s and early 2010s, that LGBTQ+ characters have only seemed to profilerate recently, compared to the slim representation given to when I was coming of age. While I found their report, I decided to see if there were any visualizations of their annual "Where We Are on TV" report. I found this one in a article from 2019. Although not the most up-to-date information, I was interested in the visualization because I felt, while it was effective at showing the marked increase of representation on television, there were other elements that made the story not as coherent as it could be. So, I took to the challenge of making it even better.

  From there, I decided to wireframe a redesign. The title of the original graphics is "Pride in Cable Television" and that this category was at an all-time high in 2018. So it was curious that the graphic included both streaming and broadcast as a category. I thought the easiest way to tell the story would be to remove these data points so the focus was solely on cable. While a simple bar graph tells the story just fine, I think a line graph really gives the impression of growth. I changed the subtitle of the graph in my wireframe to focus just on cable.
  
  While I think this was a better way to tell the story of just cable, there were still many interesting things that can be gleamed from the other data points regarding streaming and broadcast television programs that give the story of representation on the whole.
  
  I interviewed two friends - M and Y - to give me feedback about what I could do to improve the graphs, or which one would be better used in this context. M suggested that I include percentages clearly on the second wireframe I made, which Y agreed with. However, with that suggestion, I thought the graphic would too cluttered. In addition, Y asked me about my use of color in that second visualization. They wanted to know why I picked those colors, if they added anything to the story. I said I just picked a color scheme that went together. Y pointed out, and it was reaffirmed during the in-class critique, that the color yellow was eye-catching and their focus went to that part of the chart. Then I considered the type of visualization that I used for the second wireframe. It was somewhat deceptive because it made the pie charts smaller over time, even when representation was growing. With all this in mind, I gathered that simplicity was better and that the first visualization that I drafted was better at telling the story of the rise in representation.

  After I finished my critque portion of the process, I used Flourish to make the simplified graphic. I decided to use purple, a color commonly associated with the LGBTQ+ community to represent cable television programs. I used black and grey to push the other two lines, regarding broadcast and streaming, to the back. They are an important part to the data story overall, but they are not the implied story from the original title of the graphic.
