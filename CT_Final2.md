<i>Target Audience<i>

The conversation around conversion therapy is one that has been happening in activist spaces for a while now. The harmful effects of the practice have been known for years. However, because it doesnâ€™t have the same media conversations as gay marriage did in the 2000s and 2010s, I personally believe the issue is not getting a lot of attention and progress on banning the practice has been very slow. I want this project to be a source of education for those who might not know much about the issue/not know about past bans. 

My target audience with this piece are adults who might identify as straight and cisgender and do not participate in LGBTQ activism. They might have some familiarity with the issue, having heard it in passing, but they are not aware of the harmful statistics around conversion therapy. 

<i>Interviews<i>

I interviewed three people to review my storyboards - M, K, and J.  All three are in their twenties, with one in graduate school, and two working in different professions. One of these reviewers is also members of the LGBTQ community. 

Questions I asked:
1.) What do you make of the storyboard?
2.) Can you tell me what this story is telling you?
3.) What are elements of the storyboard you liked?
4) Are there any moments that need clarity?
5.) Is there anything you would change?

M (20s, Grad Student)
My interview with M was conducted in person, where they had a chance to look over my initial storyboard and wireframes. They said they could immediately tell what the story was from the title and the images used. They liked the color scheme, and felt like it was appropriate for the subject matter at hand. However, there needed to be changes to the emphasis on things - the blocks of color were not necessarily flattering. They liked the call to action, but wondered if there was something else I can add- additional resources maybe?

K (20s, Retail)
My interview with K was over Zoom. K is part of the LGBTQ community, and therefore has some familairty with the topic. They thought that it was a good introduction, but thought that I could expand on the text (which is what I was planning to do.) They also pointed out that some of the graphics were hard to see - especially the map. They suggested bolding some of the captions and changing the background to make the light states stand out. 

J (20s, Teacher)
J was my final person to interview. We met over Zoom as well. J is not part of the LGBTQ community, but is an ally and is aware of conversion therapy. Some of the ideas suggested by both M and K, such as the color change on the background and the added text. Overall, the liked the color scheme and thought the story was fairly coherent. They liked the inclusion of real color being the rainbow flag in my storyboard.
