<font size="+15"> <b>About Me</b> </font>

Hello! My name is Alexandra Kornides (she/her/hers) and I am a second year Master of Arts Management candidate. In 2020, I graduated with a B.A. in Communication from Seton Hill University (around a 45-minute drive from Pittsburgh.) For the majority of my career, I've been in the theatrical nonprofit space within a marketing capacity. Over the past summer, I worked as a Development and Donor Engagement intern at Pittsburgh Cultural Trust and helped build a new system for managing their mass email campaigns. While I love working with creating engaging content, my roles has shifted more towards data analytics.

After graduating from CMU, I'd like to continue working as a marketing professional - perhaps here in Pittsburgh, perhaps elsewhere. 

What I Hope to Learn

Like I said, my roles in organizations have gradually changed to more analyzing data. I want to learn how to effectively represent what the data says in my research for coworkers and board members. I want to learn how to be a better designer for graphs and charts that make stronger points.

Understanding the debt to GDP is an important indicator of a nation's financial health. While the previous graph looks at the ratio of debt to GDP through time by using a line graph, the data visualization above looks to see if there are any trends by utilizing the trend line. Trend lines are used to understand how the dots on a scatter plot align, if there is a high correlation between the x and y axis.

I found this visualization in a strange, roundabout way. Recently a televsion program I enjoy was nominated for a GLAAD Best New Series award and upon hearing about its nomination, I was interested in check out GLAAD's website to see if there was information about LGBTQ+ representation on television and in film. I knew, as a child growing up in the 2000s and early 2010s, that LGBTQ+ characters have only seemed to profilerate recently, compared to the slim representation given to when I was coming of age. While I found their report, I decided to see if there were any visualizations of their annual "Where We Are on TV" report. I found this one in a article from 2019. Although not the most up-to-date information, I was interested in the visualization because I felt, while it was effective at showing the marked increase of representation on television, there were other elements that made the story not as coherent as it could be. So, I took to the challenge of making it even better.

  From there, I decided to wireframe a redesign. The title of the original graphics is "Pride in Cable Television" and that this category was at an all-time high in 2018. So it was curious that the graphic included both streaming and broadcast as a category. I thought the easiest way to tell the story would be to remove these data points so the focus was solely on cable. While a simple bar graph tells the story just fine, I think a line graph really gives the impression of growth. I changed the subtitle of the graph in my wireframe to focus just on cable.
  
  While I think this was a better way to tell the story of just cable, there were still many interesting things that can be gleamed from the other data points regarding streaming and broadcast television programs that give the story of representation on the whole.
  
  I interviewed two friends - M and Y - to give me feedback about what I could do to improve the graphs, or which one would be better used in this context. M suggested that I include percentages clearly on the second wireframe I made, which Y agreed with. However, with that suggestion, I thought the graphic would too cluttered. In addition, Y asked me about my use of color in that second visualization. They wanted to know why I picked those colors, if they added anything to the story. I said I just picked a color scheme that went together. Y pointed out, and it was reaffirmed during the in-class critique, that the color yellow was eye-catching and their focus went to that part of the chart. Then I considered the type of visualization that I used for the second wireframe. It was somewhat deceptive because it made the pie charts smaller over time, even when representation was growing. With all this in mind, I gathered that simplicity was better and that the first visualization that I drafted was better at telling the story of the rise in representation.

  After I finished my critque portion of the process, I used Flourish to make the simplified graphic. I decided to use purple, a color commonly associated with the LGBTQ+ community to represent cable television programs. I used black and grey to push the other two lines, regarding broadcast and streaming, to the back. They are an important part to the data story overall, but they are not the implied story from the original title of the graphic.

 <i>Outline</i>
   
   As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I remember feeling overjoyed that Obergefell vs. Hodges made same-sex marriage legal in all fifty states. While 2015 was an important moment for LGBTQ+ Americans, there is still a constant battle for legislation that will protect the lives of LGBTQ+ teens and young adults. While I was initally planning to do a project about LGBT+ discrimination in the US in general, including anti-trans bills that are being proposes at an alarming rates, I decided to focus into the practice of conversion therapy. Conversion therapy is the harmful practice that believes sexuality can be changed, speacifically homosexuality to heterosexuality. This pseudotherapy is extremely harmful to the lives of LGBTQ+ youth that are forced to undergo it. Recently, states have begun to challenge these practices by enacting bans. So far, only 20 states have ratified these bans that will save lives, and therefore, there must be a push to get the remaining 30 to challenge conversion therapy as well.</i>

 <i>Initial Sketches</i>

   One of the most effective visualizations for showcasing how many places in the US have banned conversion therapy will be a map of the United States. I want to create something fairly interactive and engaging that not only shows where CT is banned, but when it was banned in each state. I also want to highlight the states where legislation is being considered. This way, the audience can see if their homestate has made such legislation and if they haven't, they'll be more empowered to contact their represenatives about it.
   
   The second sketch that I made is fairly serious as mental health issues and suicide ideation are a big part of why conversion therapy is so dangerous to LGBT youth. Therefore, I think presenting a stark visualization shows the urgency of the subject matter.

  >his visualization is one I want to get more data on regarding the nature of the conversion therapy organizations. I would like to see a breakdown of what religions/denominations are focused in creating this type of therapy. However, I think show how large a majority of those who go through conversion therapy are at religious organizations show who central these are who undergone CT.

  I tried to find some fairly reputable sources for my project from organizations that have a strong track record in presenting accurate information about LGBTQ+ issues, particuarly GLAAD and Human Rights Council. The information I pulled included some visualizations that I would like to re-imagine for my project, but most of the sources include enough data in other forms that I will be able to pull other information that will be helpful. Reading through the above sites were very helpful in deciding the direction and the story of my project, and I will most likely dig around some more on these websites in order to gain more of an idea around the issue. Some of the sources I found were a couple years old. While this might still be relevant for topics particuarly concerning mental health, the information regarding where bans have occured might not be.
    
 
 <i>Medium and Method</i>
    
 <i>Some of the technologies I will use in this project include Flourish and Tableau for creating some of the data visualizations, particularly the interactive map that I want to create to have the audience know where the bans are and are not. All of my data above is publically sourced, so using Flourish should be fine. I believe that I might also use Canva as a tool for making some other graphics/other elements of the project. I have found this tool to be particuarly useful in past projects, and can add some exciting visual elements. For the website itself, I'm hoping to use Shorthand. I really want my call to action to be the audience look up their represenatives in their home state if there in no ban there, and be able to advocate directly from the website. Therefore, Shorthand would be an effective way to tell this story.

<i>Target Audience<i>

The conversation around conversion therapy is one that has been happening in activist spaces for a while now. The harmful effects of the practice have been known for years. However, because it doesn’t have the same media conversations as gay marriage did in the 2000s and 2010s, I personally believe the issue is not getting a lot of attention and progress on banning the practice has been very slow. I want this project to be a source of education for those who might not know much about the issue/not know about past bans. 

My target audience with this piece are adults who might identify as straight and cisgender and do not participate in LGBTQ activism. They might have some familiarity with the issue, having heard it in passing, but they are not aware of the harmful statistics around conversion therapy. 

<i>Interviews<i>

I interviewed three people to review my storyboards - M, K, and J.  All three are in their twenties, with one in graduate school, and two working in different professions. One of these reviewers is also members of the LGBTQ community. 

Questions I asked:
1.) What do you make of the storyboard?
2.) Can you tell me what this story is telling you?
3.) What are elements of the storyboard you liked?
4) Are there any moments that need clarity?
5.) Is there anything you would change?

M (20s, Grad Student)
My interview with M was conducted in person, where they had a chance to look over my initial storyboard and wireframes. They said they could immediately tell what the story was from the title and the images used. They liked the color scheme, and felt like it was appropriate for the subject matter at hand. However, there needed to be changes to the emphasis on things - the blocks of color were not necessarily flattering. They liked the call to action, but wondered if there was something else I can add- additional resources maybe?

K (20s, Retail)
My interview with K was over Zoom. K is part of the LGBTQ community, and therefore has some familairty with the topic. They thought that it was a good introduction, but thought that I could expand on the text (which is what I was planning to do.) They also pointed out that some of the graphics were hard to see - especially the map. They suggested bolding some of the captions and changing the background to make the light states stand out. 

J (20s, Teacher)
J was my final person to interview. We met over Zoom as well. J is not part of the LGBTQ community, but is an ally and is aware of conversion therapy. Some of the ideas suggested by both M and K, such as the color change on the background and the added text. Overall, the liked the color scheme and thought the story was fairly coherent. They liked the inclusion of real color being the rainbow flag in my storyboard.
