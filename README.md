About Me

Hello! My name is Alexandra Kornides (she/her/hers) and I am a second year Master of Arts Management candidate. In 2020, I graduated with a B.A. in Communication from Seton Hill University (around a 45-minute drive from Pittsburgh.) For the majority of my career, I've been in the theatrical nonprofit space within a marketing capacity. Over the past summer, I worked as a Development and Donor Engagement intern at Pittsburgh Cultural Trust and helped build a new system for managing their mass email campaigns. While I love working with creating engaging content, my roles has shifted more towards data analytics.

After graduating from CMU, I'd like to continue working as a marketing professional - perhaps here in Pittsburgh, perhaps elsewhere. 

What I Hope to Learn

Like I said, my roles in organizations have gradually changed to more analyzing data. I want to learn how to effectively represent what the data says in my research for coworkers and board members. I want to learn how to be a better designer for graphs and charts that make stronger points.

Visualizing Government Debt

Understanding the debt to GDP is an important indicator of a nation's financial health. While the previous graph looks at the ratio of debt to GDP through time by using a line graph, the data visualization above looks to see if there are any trends by utilizing the trend line. Trend lines are used to understand how the dots on a scatter plot align, if there is a high correlation between the x and y axis.

I found this visualization in a strange, roundabout way. Recently a televsion program I enjoy was nominated for a GLAAD Best New Series award and upon hearing about its nomination, I was interested in check out GLAAD's website to see if there was information about LGBTQ+ representation on television and in film. I knew, as a child growing up in the 2000s and early 2010s, that LGBTQ+ characters have only seemed to profilerate recently, compared to the slim representation given to when I was coming of age. While I found their report, I decided to see if there were any visualizations of their annual "Where We Are on TV" report. I found this one in a article from 2019. Although not the most up-to-date information, I was interested in the visualization because I felt, while it was effective at showing the marked increase of representation on television, there were other elements that made the story not as coherent as it could be. So, I took to the challenge of making it even better.
