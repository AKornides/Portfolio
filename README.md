<font size="+15"> <b>About Me</b> </font>

Hello! My name is Alexandra Kornides (she/her/hers) and I am a second year Master of Arts Management candidate. In 2020, I graduated with a B.A. in Communication from Seton Hill University (around a 45-minute drive from Pittsburgh.) For the majority of my career, I've been in the theatrical nonprofit space within a marketing capacity. Over the past summer, I worked as a Development and Donor Engagement intern at Pittsburgh Cultural Trust and helped build a new system for managing their mass email campaigns. While I love working with creating engaging content, my roles has shifted more towards data analytics.

After graduating from CMU, I'd like to continue working as a marketing professional - perhaps here in Pittsburgh, perhaps elsewhere. 

What I Hope to Learn

Like I said, my roles in organizations have gradually changed to more analyzing data. I want to learn how to effectively represent what the data says in my research for coworkers and board members. I want to learn how to be a better designer for graphs and charts that make stronger points.
