 <i>Outline</i>
   
   As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I remember feeling overjoyed that Obergefell vs. Hodges made same-sex marriage legal in all fifty states. While 2015 was an important moment for LGBTQ+ Americans, there is still a constant battle for legislation that will protect the lives of LGBTQ+ teens and young adults. While I was initally planning to do a project about LGBT+ discrimination in the US in general, including anti-trans bills that are being proposes at an alarming rates, I decided to focus into the practice of conversion therapy. Conversion therapy is the harmful practice that believes sexuality can be changed, speacifically homosexuality to heterosexuality. This pseudotherapy is extremely harmful to the lives of LGBTQ+ youth that are forced to undergo it. Recently, states have begun to challenge these practices by enacting bans. So far, only 20 states have ratified these bans that will save lives, and therefore, there must be a push to get the remaining 30 to challenge conversion therapy as well.</i>

 <i>Initial Sketches</i>
   
   ![Sketch 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98241953/154403774-eafee907-be36-4df5-9a44-ba6ada07f9f6.png)
   
   One of the most effective visualizations for showcasing how many places in the US have banned conversion therapy will be a map of the United States. I want to create something fairly interactive and engaging that not only shows where CT is banned, but when it was banned in each state. I also want to highlight the states where legislation is being considered. This way, the audience can see if their homestate has made such legislation and if they haven't, they'll be more empowered to contact their represenatives about it.
   
   The second sketch that I made is fairly serious as mental health issues and suicide ideation are a big part of why conversion therapy is so dangerous to LGBT youth. Therefore, I think presenting a stark visualization shows the urgency of the subject matter.

  >his visualization is one I want to get more data on regarding the nature of the conversion therapy organizations. I would like to see a breakdown of what religions/denominations are focused in creating this type of therapy. However, I think show how large a majority of those who go through conversion therapy are at religious organizations show who central these are who undergone CT.

  I tried to find some fairly reputable sources for my project from organizations that have a strong track record in presenting accurate information about LGBTQ+ issues, particuarly GLAAD and Human Rights Council. The information I pulled included some visualizations that I would like to re-imagine for my project, but most of the sources include enough data in other forms that I will be able to pull other information that will be helpful. Reading through the above sites were very helpful in deciding the direction and the story of my project, and I will most likely dig around some more on these websites in order to gain more of an idea around the issue. Some of the sources I found were a couple years old. While this might still be relevant for topics particuarly concerning mental health, the information regarding where bans have occured might not be.
    
 
 <i>Medium and Method</i>
    
 <i>Some of the technologies I will use in this project include Flourish and Tableau for creating some of the data visualizations, particularly the interactive map that I want to create to have the audience know where the bans are and are not. All of my data above is publically sourced, so using Flourish should be fine. I believe that I might also use Canva as a tool for making some other graphics/other elements of the project. I have found this tool to be particuarly useful in past projects, and can add some exciting visual elements. For the website itself, I'm hoping to use Shorthand. I really want my call to action to be the audience look up their represenatives in their home state if there in no ban there, and be able to advocate directly from the website. Therefore, Shorthand would be an effective way to tell this story.
