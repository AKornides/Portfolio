I always maintained that I wanted the target audience to be younger people who do not know about conversion therapy/straight and cisgender people who might not have this in their awareness. 
Therefore, I think I felt like I did a decent job at trying to make the material engaging enough by including visuals and information about why they should care about the topic. 
However, the feedback I received in [Part Two](/CT_Final2.md) was helpful in fixing some of the elements in my data story to make it a little more clear. I did some more research, including watching a few videos about people's experience with conversion therapy. I wanted to add a qualitative element to the project, because there really hasn't been a ton of studies on LGBT youth and conversion therapy because it is such a taboo. I added the one great quote from an NPR interview to add a more human element to the project. In my additional reading and research, I found some other great data points to further develop both the narrative in a writing sense and a data visualization sense.

In terms of my call to action, I decided to write out a little bit more about having conversaions about conversion therapy, raising awareness of the issue beyond just contacting represenatives. I wondered if I should have included anything about the recent legislation in Texas and Florida, which relate to LGBT youth, but I decided against it. I tried to get a widget where a person could directly look up their current represenatives, but I struggled with it, so I added a button to another website that would do the same function. Additionally, I found some resources for anyone interesting in further reading/looking into organizations who are supportive of LGBT youth. It's not an exhuastive list, but I thought it was a decent start.

Finally, regarding feedback that I received in earlier parts, I wanted to vary the data visualizations to include more than pie charts. I included the map, although I struggled to get it to exactly what I enivioned it to be, where it was a little more interactive. I also struggled to figure out how to have it become inclusive of the 100 or so municipalities that have enacted conversion therapy bans. If I was to re-do an element of my project, it would be working to re-do this so it was a little more fully realized. I do wonder if the one visualization, of the trans men who are subjected to conversion therapy, really fit in or did much to forwardthe story. 

There are still things that I would change about my final project, but overall I am fairly satisfied with the finished product.
